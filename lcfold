# Fold (break) long lines by adding '\n ' as done e.g. in LDIF (RFC 2849)
# and iCalendar (RFC 5545). This script uses a hardcoded maximum line
# length of 72 characters.
#
# This script breaks a line after 72 characters, any subsequents breaks
# of the same input line result in 73 character long lines caused by the
# additional whitespace character added to the output, but not counted
# as input.
