# Fold (break) long lines by adding '\n ' as done e.g. in LDIF (RFC 2849),
# iCalendar (RFC 5545), or HTTP (RFC 2616). This script uses a hardcoded
# maximum line length of 72 characters.
#
# This script breaks a line after 72 characters, any subsequents breaks
# of the same input line occur after 71 characters because of the <space>
# character added to the output.
