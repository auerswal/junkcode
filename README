Erik's Junk Code

This repository contains pieces of code that I have written to e.g. learn
something or try something out. They may be useful as examples.

My "single file tools" (https://github.com/auerswal/sft) repository is
for ready-to-use tools that I intend to use regularly, while this junkcode
repository is for examples or one-off solutions.

This collection of junk code is inspired by Andrew "Tridge" Tridgell's
junk code:
