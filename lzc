# Remove leading zeros in (hexa)decimal numbers. For IPv6 addresses this
# is known as "leading zero compression", hence the name. In electrical
# engineering this is known as suppression of leading zeros.

# Each segment of zeros to remove must be anchored between two non xdigits.
# This means that one s///g invocation skips every second group of xdigits.
# The same s///g invocation can be used twice.
#s/\(^\|[^[:xdigit:]]\)0\+\([[:xdigit:]]\+\([^[:xdigit:]]\|$\)\)/\1\2/g
#s/\(^\|[^[:xdigit:]]\)0\+\([[:xdigit:]]\+\([^[:xdigit:]]\|$\)\)/\1\2/g
# Alternatively, whenever leading zeros are compressed (or suppressed),
# the script can jump (branch) back to re-start the substitution. With
# this re-starting, the "g" flag to the s/// command is no longer needed.
